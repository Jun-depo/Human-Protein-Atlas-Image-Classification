# Human-Protein-Atlas-Image-Classification
## Human Protein Atlas Image Classification (Kaggle competiton).

### Introduction

  Different proteins are localized at different places inside the cell. Target protein localization patterns are labeled by antibodies that is revealed in the green channel of images, along with microtubules (red), endoplasmatic reticulum (yellow) and nuclei (blue).  Based on lables of the training set, classification models need to learn to distinguish 28 different protein localization patterns.  Each protein can be localized at multiple cellular locations, carring multiple labels.

  Iniatial data analysis showed that there are many examples of proteins localized at nucleoplasm, cytosol, plasma membrane, nucleoli, mitochondria, golgi apparatus and nuclear bodies.  Very few examples of proteins localized at aggresome,         mitotic spindle, lipid droplets, peroxisomes, endosomes, lysosomes, microtubule ends, rods & rings as shown inthe figure below)
